# API Authentication Test Findings

## Summary
We attempted to test authentication between the UI and the API containers but encountered several issues that prevented successful testing. Below are our findings and recommendations.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Unhealthy API Container
- The `dev-api-1` container is running but marked as 'unhealthy'
- The health check is failing because the `/health` endpoint is not available
- The health check is configured to call `curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1`

### 2. Database Connection Issues in Web Container
- The `dev-web-1` container is running but missing the PostgreSQL gem (`pg`)
- Error: `Error loading the 'postgresql' Active Record adapter. Missing a gem it depends on? pg is not part of the bundle.`
- This prevents the Rails application from connecting to the database

### 3. API Controller Issues
- The API endpoints return 404 or 500 errors
- Error on `/api/users` endpoint: `ActionNotFound: The action 'frontend_index_fallback' could not be found for ApplicationController`
- The `verify_authenticity_token` callback is not defined but is being skipped

## Recommendations

1. **Fix the API Container Health Check**:
   - Create a proper `HealthController` with a `show` action
   - Update the health check URL in the Docker configuration
   - Alternatively, modify the health check to use a simpler test

2. **Add PostgreSQL Support**:
   - Add the `pg` gem to the Gemfile and run `bundle install`
   - Ensure the database connection settings are properly configured
   - Test database connectivity with `rails db:migrate:status`

3. **Fix API Controller Setup**:
   - Ensure the API controllers inherit from `ActionController::API` or properly handle CSRF token verification
   - Check that routes are properly defined and controllers exist at the correct locations
   - Add appropriate error handling for API requests

4. **Test API Endpoints Individually**:
   - Once the containers are healthy, test each API endpoint individually to verify functionality
   - Use Postman or curl to test authentication endpoints
   - Implement the UI integration tests only after API functionality is confirmed

## Conclusion
The current setup has several configuration issues that need to be addressed before the authentication between the UI and API can be properly tested. The most critical issues are the database connectivity problem and the API controller setup. Once these are resolved, testing can proceed using either direct API calls or integration with the UI components.
